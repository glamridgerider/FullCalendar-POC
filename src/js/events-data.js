                        A lovely sunny day.
                        Initial stage out on towpath to Greywell. various off road sections are connected with some road sections.
                        The off road sections were 'challenging' and seem to become progressively worse, many sections churned up by 4x4s and off road motorbikes.
                        About 17 miles into the ride, on one off road section...downhill, gully like, rock strewn...one of us ...(that'll be me, Andy), lost it and hit the deck hard, slamming into the rock floor. I was then grateful for the first aider training of others and I got the joys of an ambulance ride back to Basingstoke hospital - don't worry my bike was fine! :)
                        The original ride was abandoned and the 5 riders made their way back to Fleet on the most direct route with a food stop and just one mechanical.`,

                        10:55 - 1 hr 55 mins to The Lightbox, Woking (18 miles). Towpath was firm going, stop for food and coffee, approx 35-40 mins stop.
                        12:05 - 3 hrs 5 mins to Weybridge (24 miles) averaging 11 mph to this point.
                        13:10 - 4 hrs 10 mins saw us at Hampton Court (32 miles), from here the Thames path is generally in good condition and wide, there are occassional pinch points and can be lots of people, especially in areas with Rowing clubs by the river. It felt as if we were in open countryside for the majority of the way.
                        Progress slowed in the last 4 miles as the route sometimes left the river side and also the volume of people increased.
                        16:15 - 7 hrs 15 mins, we arrived at Waterloo, hopped on a train and headed back to Fleet!
                        17:40 - The train had us back in Fleet
                        Overall average 10mph, 57 miles logged

                        A very varied and mixture of surfaces, different and challenging, mostly dry and hardpacked.
                        11:20 - Approx 2 hrs 20 mins to get to Guildford, 19 miles into the ride.
                        12:15 - Around 3 hrs 15 mins to Watts Gallery, 22 miles in. A lovely place to stop, the food and coffee was very good, but it took a while to arrive (an hour+).
                        14:35 - 5 hrs 40 mins to Farnham....after several hills and then there was the climb out of Farnham!
                        15:50 - 6 hrs 50 mins back in Fleet...38 miles
                        No major mechanicals
                        It was good to see that folks were taking fuel and fluid onboard at every opportunity and it seemed to help, no one seemed to be suffering at the end - a lovely, challenging ride - thanks all.`,

            rideNotes: `Due to a Yellow weather warning for Sat 24/08, this was rescheduled to Sun 25/08.
                        09:00 Just one left from Fleet
                        09:30 (5.5 miles) A rendezvous at Ash Lock with Ally meant there were 2!
                        09:50 (9 miles) Frimley area and Spike was waiting for us, then there were 3! The going was generally good, even after the previously days rain, the towpath did seem busier than usual, but that might well be due to the day before being a wash out.
                        18 miles in and we were at Woking …I think it was new territory for Ally and Spike beyond this point
                        24 miles saw us in Weybridge and we were stood by the River Wey. We managed to convince Ally to press on to Hampton Court. The scenery is pretty spectacular as we ride alongside the River Thames, the path is wider and there are more folks out and about.
                        12:30 (31 miles) and we arrived at Hampton Court. Locked the bikes and headed into ‘Dish’ (well worth a visit)…we sat in the rear courtyard area and enjoyed a great Full English at a reasonable price! The ride out did seem like tough going and the head wind was worse on the return journey! As we rejoined the Basing Canal at Weybridge, sad to see 3 idiots (late teens/early 20s) with their fishing gear, but throwing stones/rocks across the canal at glass office build, they had cracked or smashed several large panes!
                        15:10 (44 miles) 2 of us played our ‘Get out of Jail’ cards and opted for the train back. As we walked through the town, we helped a guy who was struggling to refit and pump up a tube/tyre. He had the right stuff, but didn’t understand how his pump worked (I’d suggest that we all check and understand how to use the pumps we carry) and also couldn’t fit the new inner tube ….we left him happy and busy pumping the tyre up.
                        16:15 …finally home. Great riding companions and lovely views!`,

            This route is mainly flat going, however things to note :
            > Ensure that you are carrying enough water, aim for 0.5 litres per hour of riding, ideally have 2 litres of water.
            > Ensure that you have suitable snacks and take them onboard at every opportunity, do not wait until you are hungry!
            > We need to maintain a reasonable pace of 10mph all the way there and back, otherwise we are riding in the dark...and no, we do NOT want to be riding in the dark!
            > The schedule:
            - Depart 08:30
            - Approx 10:45 Coffee stop, Southwater Country park (21 miles). Coffee, cake and ensure that you FILL your water bottles
            - 13:00 Sat on the beach at Shoreham-by-Sea and eating. Please bring picnic lunch, we do not go to a cafe.
            - 14:00 or earlier, we need to leave the coast and head back
            - 15:40 Coffee stop, Southwater Country park ..it closes at 16:00! Again FILL your water bottles
            - 18:30 Fingers crossed we are back in Guildford!
            Be prepared, have plenty of water and snacks. The Full Monty is 8 hours of riding and 10 hours start to finish.
            If you are considering opting out at any point, please ensure you know the nearest Railway stations etc and how to get back to Guildford.
            Many options for shorter rides, cafe stop at 21 miles, thus folks can return from there. Various options for trains back to Guildford. All can be catered for!
            1. Ice Cream Run : Ride to Southwater Country Park Cafe - 21 miles each way (42 total)
            2. Sails and Rails : Ride to Shorham by Sea, see the sails/boats and catch the train back, approx 38 miles
            3. Full Monty : Guildford to Shoreham-by-sea and return ....76 miles!`,
            rideNotes: `08:30 Eight folks at the start point, although the start was still delayed by a few mins! The weather was pretty much perfect, overcast, but warm enough
                        We did the fiddly bit getting out of Guildford. Lots of help given to the tandem to lift and move it up/down steps and over gates.
                        George and Pauline (Tandem riders) dropped out for coffee at about 9 mile mark
                        The Super Six carried on ...although we had an unscheduled comfort stop at about 10 miles...the clock ticked on... and a few stops for pics ...we had to press on and hence were riding at around 11mph
                        10:50 (21 miles) we made it to the coffee stop at Southwater Country park
                        We headed to the beach! ...we had the mandatory puncture on the way
                        13:10 (38 miles) we arrived on the beach, Rob had a paddle ...the rest of us fed our faces
                        13:50 ...ish ...we started back ...after a few miles we turned off the route for an unscheduled coffee stop (maybe 15-20 mins?) ...Pam and Karen wanted to get a head start and carried on ...We did catch up to them within a few miles...we pressed on
                        15:40 (55 miles) We rolled into the scheduled Coffee stop at Southwater Country park again...we are all looking dusty! lol
                        18:31 ...we were in Guildford...pretty much bang on time! Well done everyone! ...a very fun and dusty ride! :) Note for next year…run this event earlier in the year to avoid the mud!
                        After the ride we found out that Steve had been busy getting his money's worth out of his train ticket...having got from Guildford to Woking ...he then got on a train back to Guildford.....just to do the Guildford to Woking section again ! ...Doh !`,

                        09:15 The first ‘fun thing’ of the ride…a broken chain (Andy) …quick link snapped and also a plate on another linked broken. No option but to head home ….the rest headed to Poppys Café (lucky them). Replacement bike collected and arranged a meet point…we lost about 45 minutes!
                        We lost the route up Caesars camp and ended up climbing Brick Hill….not even Steve could ride it !
                        Many of the tracks were wet and muddy, slowing progress.
                        It was similar as we headed down Old Park Lane, many muddy patches.
                        The situation continued as we climbed and descended, water and mud, making it difficult to maintain any reasonable speed and difficult to get traction on climbs.
                        13:00 (20 miles, 4 hours) Arrived in Guildford, where we follow the rules and walked down “Porridge Pot Alley” only to get shouted at by an older women ….as she was late and in a hurry! …..maybe she was the White Rabbit?
                        The Café had a reasonable selection, we all stocked up!
                        13:45 Left the café and headed back out on the route. Steve decided to be sensible (very strange …lol ) and get the train back and protect his dodgy knee…so then there were 4 of us.
                        The Wey navigation track was narrow, rutted, muddy, wet and slow going ! Along the route we had a chain off (Neil) …and a fall into nettles (Karen) ….then issues with cramp set in for Spike.
                        We stopped at pub in Send (approx 30 miles) and Spike got crisps (for the salt), Neil opted out and headed home by road, then there were THREE ! Spike was suffering and we needed frequent breaks.
                        Just along from the pub, there was a tree down across the path and we had to clamber over.
                        Another few miles on and we found the path blocked by a herd cows …we had to navigate through and around
                        16:00 (32 miles, 7 hours) …12 miles from Guildford we finally joined the Basingstoke Canal
                        16:55 (36 miles, nearly 8 hours) At Woking we cut our losses and caught a train ! …a very eventful day!
                        17:25 …ish finally home ! Neil had punctured on his road journey home. So we all had had issues on the day! ….but the sun was out, the weather was good, great company and all seemed to enjoy!
                        Note for next year…run this event earlier in the year to avoid the mud!
                        After the ride we found out that Steve had been busy getting his money's worth out of his train ticket...having got from Guildford to Woking ...he then got on a train back to Guildford.....just to do the Guildford to Woking section again ! ...Doh !`,

                        We shared our live location as we were also meeting up with a new rider (Hi Jeico). We found Jeico at Ash lock and headed onwards.
                        Steve finally caught up with us just after Mytchett Canal boat centre (about 9 miles!)...and seemed a tad out of breath ...lol! he'd been chasing for 50 mins!
                        Just before getting to Woking, we had a minor mechanical ....a loose quick release allowed a rear wheel to drop out and lock up!
                        The mandatory pic of H.G. Wells taken and then to the Cafe.
                        The return journey was uneventful with various folks peeling off at points suitable to them with 4 of us arriving back in Fleet. The weather was ideal and a pleasant temp!`,
